Things not to forget to emphasize:
* This a vault designed around the new frontmatter (aka properties) aka metadata integration
* Unless explicitly specified elsewhere, this vault will make the following assumptions
  Although there can be slight conceptual differences between obsidian 'frontmatter' vs 'metadata', we make the following assumptions.
  As long as we access *all* frontmatter fields through the MetaData Menu API (https://mdelobelle.github.io/metadatamenu/api/), we can
  treat obsidian native frontmatter and the slightly more powerful metadata interface it exposes as conceptually equivalent.
