# My_Plugin_List
[[MPL|My Plugin List]] (aka MPL) is a sort of running stream of consciousness about the obsidian plugins I am either currently using (or studying) to get a better idea of how all these disparate projects manage to interface with each-other

For ease of reference, this list is broken down into the following structure

`./my_plugin_list/obsidian-module-name’
 where `obsidian-module-name` is the unique identifier each plugin decides to publish inside its `manifest.js`  file

For example: 
## An example: Templater
The community plugin we all know and love is most commonly referred to as Template*r*. (This is often and easily confused with the [[core-plugin]]: Template*s*). 

```ad-info
collapse: open

Fun fact! It’s not just humans that might mis-read ‘Templater’ vs ‘Templates’, but computers as well!  This is because [[ASCII]] encodes nearby letters (‘A’ | `0x41`) into nearby numbers. (‘B’ | `0x42`)

As a result the [[Hamming Distance]] between the ascii strings ‘Templater’ and ‘Templates’ is precisely, one bit. This is the type of [[bitflip]] most likely to occur in consumer devices (like the one you are reading this on!)

If this kind of information interests you, maybe you should head on over to  [[Rowhammer-Research]]
