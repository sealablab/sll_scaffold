If you are reading this then you are probably interested in how i decided to lay out the sea-lab lab obsidian vault.
First, a few simple directions if you want to follow along at home

# sll_scaffolding repository
Although I am far from perfect, I try to keep the overall __structure__ of this vault
(i.e., templates, maintenance scripts, and general approach) separate from the actual contents.
While the scaffolding repository will typically have a handful of representative notes containing content, the real reason it is kept separate is so that version control can be applied (and observed) to the overall system itself. 

## Cloning this repo:
