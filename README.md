Watch me build my obsidian vault from the bottom up!

If you are reading this then you are probably interested in how i decided to lay out the sea-lab lab obsidian vault.

Although I am far from perfect, I try to keep the overall __structure__ of this vault
(i.e., templates, maintenance scripts, and general approach re: fileClasses and metadata) separate from the actual contents.
On top of that, i make an effort to make relatively small changes in coherent branches, and explain what and how I am doing it as the overall complexity progresses. I've consumed a lot of high quality "starter vaults" from a lot of smart people, but the thing  that is usually missing is the sense of how they arrived at what is usually a very bespoke end-state.

If you ever wanted to watch the plugins and relevant 'infrastructure' of an obsidian vault designed from the ground up to utilize metadata and filelass's as first class citizens, this is the right place.
